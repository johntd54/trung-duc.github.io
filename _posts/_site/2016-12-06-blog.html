<p>Created a new post template written in Python, so that I don’t have to deal with filling out every bit of blog information anytime later</p>

<p>Now setting up nong san. Setting up nong san is actually pretty fast, thanks to all the time that I spent on abstracting the structure and creating all kinds of test for other modules. The job is basically just change the name of nongvien to nongsan lol.</p>

<p>Thinking about making image sprites and/or incorporating data uris (data uris would be good for icons in case I would not want to use sprites):
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/sprity
- https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/</p>

<p>Any way tonight I will restructure cpp project. The current structure is pretty flat and entails a lot of duplications. Restructuring the code to be a little more vertical would allow easier maintenance.</p>
