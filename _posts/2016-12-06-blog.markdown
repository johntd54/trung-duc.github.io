Created a new post template written in Python, so that I don't have to deal with filling out every bit of blog information anytime later

Now setting up nong san. Setting up nong san is actually pretty fast, thanks to all the time that I spent on abstracting the structure and creating all kinds of test for other modules. The job is basically just change the name of nongvien to nongsan lol.

Thinking about making image sprites and/or incorporating data uris (data uris would be good for icons in case I would not want to use sprites):
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/sprity
- https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/

Any way tonight I will restructure cpp project. The current structure is pretty flat and entails a lot of duplications. Restructuring the code to be a little more vertical would allow easier maintenance.
